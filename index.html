<h1> Emil's Class 8 Project</h1>
<h2> Percussion</h2>
<p>In this project will dive into the huge world of Percussion.</p>
<p>   The world of percussion cannot be narrowed down to a single definition; it is a vast family of instruments - from drums, to gongs, bells, hand-held percussion, tuned instruments, the list goes on.
<br>
  Percussion in African culture: 
In Africa, drums are used as a mode of communication; to mourn, to celebrate, to inspire and send practical messages. They would often be accompanying singing or dancing, and still do. Drummers are typically the most respected members of their community. The people of Africa didn't only have drums, they also had an early version of the marimba. 
<br>
The “Talking drum”
	Before modern times, people used Talking drums to communicate, spread news and warn off danger from village to village.  The sound produced by their drums can, on a calm and quiet day, usually travel 8 kilometers - meaning a message could be passed very quickly in a short amount of time. In many cultures, such as the Yoruba in South West Nigeria, it has an important role in religious ceremonies, festivals, and town processions. 
<br>
A skilled player is able to play whole phrases. Most talking drums sound like a human humming depending on the way they are played. Europeans therefore named it the “talking drum”. Its name changes in different West African countries "Dùndún" (Yoruba - south west Nigeria), "Tama" (Senegal), "Kalangu" (Hausa), and "Gangan" (other parts of Nigeria).
<br>
The “Talking drum” is a surprisingly small drum that a player would have hanging under their arm (usually their left), with a curved stick in the other hand. The drum has two skins and a set of strings that can, when squeezed, tighten the skin changing the pitch of the drum. The drummer would gently hit the drum with the stick so as not to break the skin; which is surprising for the distance the sound reaches. It is usually only one person playing it. Learning to play this drum is traditionally passed from father to son. The use of the talking-drum was forbidden in the United States during the enslavement era because of its ability to "speak" in an unknown language and possibly incite rebellion. 
<br>
The Djembe: 
The Djembe is said to be created by the Mandinka tribe of West Africa in the 12th century. This Djembe is of the most famous African drums and can be found all over the world: The Djembe became known world wide when some Europeans went to Africa and brought back some of the drums, which later spread through Europe. The Djembe has three basic sounds; bass, tone, and slap; the bass sound is made by hitting the drum in the middle, the tone is on the edge, with fingers together, and the slap is done in a similar way to the tone, but without the fingers together.  
<br>
Making the drums:
	Making these drums is something that the West African drum makers take very seriously. It is a ceremonial activity. They use wood, sometimes clay, animal skin (usually goat) metal rings (of different sizes), some felt and some form of long string or rope. They would then carve the wood into a symmetrical funnel shape. Then, if they wanted to carve patterns on the body ( the wooden part),  they would take the 3 metal rings and wrap them with a long strip of felt so they wouldn't damage the wooden body. Then, the smallest of the rings would be taken and slotted through the bottom of the drum. Then, the second biggest would be wrapped with animal skin and attached to the metal ring. Then, the last and biggest ring (that has a series of strings attached around it) would be placed on top of the ring with the skin, on the top of the drum. Finally, it would be tied by the other end of the strings to the smallest ring further down the drum. 
<br>
The Balafon
<br>
The Balafon is a West African xylophone with calabash (gourd) resonators, traditionally played by griots (oral historians and musicians) and used in ceremonies and music for praise of kings. 
<br>
It is closely associated with the Mandé, Bwaba Bobo, Senoufo and Gur peoples of West Africa, particularly the Guinean branch of the Mandinka ethnic group. 
Variations exist across West Africa, including the balangi in Sierra Leone and the gyil of the Dagara, Lobi and Gurunsi from Ghana, Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast.
This instrument has a history that is tied to the stories and legends of the formation of the Mandinka Empire, a story similar to the Arthurian legends of the West. A story of a king, Sunjata Keita, who united the warring tribes by prowess and magic, and created an era of peace and prosperity, sometime in the 13th or 14th century. The Griots, or Jelis, as they are more commonly called in The Gambia, were the praised singers and court musicians of the Mandinka Empire. Stories of the first balafon, given by a spirit to Sunjata, and the first balafon player seem to date from this time.
<br>
America has been the pioneer for fusing West African, Chinese and Latin percussion instruments to form one unified system, known as the drum kit. It is still considered as a ‘new’ instrument, having been invented in the late 1800’s/early 1900’s. 
<br>
The drum kit was created around 1865 after the American civil war, as people from all over the world began to go to America. Many went by boat or had their belongings shipped, meaning native instruments were brought with them. The toms, for example, came from China, cymbals from East Asia and the snare and bass drum came from Europe. 
<br>
The drum kit (or drum set) originated in New Orleans, a port in the southern states of Louisiana in the United States of America, and has been evolving ever since; from around the beginning of the 19th century all the way until now. 
<br>
Dee Dee Chandler is often credited as one of the first drummers to use a makeshift pedal to play the bass drum with his foot while playing snare with his hands; this invention was quite rudimentary as it was hard to use.  There is only one photo of him that exists, and it is in this 1896 photo that we can see down at the corner of the frame, the pedal on his bass drum. He was considered by other drummers to be one of the best of his time, an, “excellent showman and comic,” who “played with the grace of a professional juggler.” His drums were tuned in a distinctly sharp way that “made the drum roll sound like he was tearing a piece of cloth.” One could argue that this is where the kit originates.
<br>
Before the creation of the drum kit, drums and cymbals were used in military and orchestral musical settings and were played separately by different percussionists. This is still the case in civil and military orchestras today.  
<br>
Economics also played a part in the construction of the drum kit. Having limited space and budget in a musical theater resulted in the development of new techniques and devices that would enable one person to replace multiple percussionists. Additionally, one could argue that the evolution of the drum kit owes its existence in part to the music itself; swing and groove is difficult to develop with several drummers playing at the same time, as the beat has to remain rigid in order to accommodate each player's rhythmic interpretation. The drum kit was initially called ‘the trap set’, and up to the 1930s drummers were called ‘trap drummers’.
<br>
In 1909 William and Theobolt Luwig patented the first kick drum pedal; it was not used much as it was hard to control. But later in 1934 they made a new pedal called the ‘speed king pedal’ which is essentially still the same today. The invention of the pedal is probably the most significant innovation to the development of the drum kit as we know it today because it freed the player from having to play all elements of the beat with their hands alone, allowing a freer and more innovative approach to the creation of beats.

Timpani
<br>
Timpani are very large round copper and brass drums with a deep resounding sound.
<br>
The timpani began as a military instrument and by the end of the 18th century, ‘til now, it became an essential part in orchestral music. They are also known as kettle drums because they look like large upside down tea kettles. They are very loud drums.  The theory of the creation of the instrument goes that the skin of the animal, which was hunted, was lapped over the bowl from which it was eaten.
<br>
The Timpani drums have been a part of an orchestra from the Baroque time. The sound of the drums depends on the size of the drum, thickness of the skin, the acoustics and the weather. The weather might not seem like something that could have such an impact on the note that is played, but like all hide skin drums, (animal skin) temperature and humidity levels have a significant impact on the note that the instrument is tuned to. Nowadays timpani (pedal timpani) are one of the only percussion instruments that can be tuned on the fly without any sort of tool, apart from a simple pedal. In the Baroque and Classical era, they had to use a drum key which was much harder.   In those times the drum key for timps were big, and loud to use in changing a note. Can you imagine sitting in a concert, in a quiet part, and then hearing a loud creaking noise from the timpanist? For me, that would spoil the concert. Even so, the timps are one of the coolest instruments. 
<br>
Today the skin can either be cow skin or plastic.  Now I know that it might not be ethical to use animal skin, (same as Western African traditions), but it undoubtedly creates a far better organic sound than the plastic skins which are used as an alternative. The weather has a massive effect on timpani made with cow skin; when it is hot and dry outside, the skin will be tight, and when it is cold and damp outside, the skin will be loose. And lastly, the sound of any instrument will need to be taken into consideration when playing in a dry recording studio versus in St. Paul’s Cathedral!
<br>
The pitch of the drums varies depending on the size of the drum, thickness of the skin, weather condition and acoustics. Timpani can range from 20” to 40” in diameter, though generally the sizes used in orchestra are from 23” to 32”. 
<br>
The Baroque Period:
<br>
Timpani were a luxury or novelty extra (used to add splendour in ceremonial settings). They were included in very few compositions. In the C17th and C18th timpani were mostly used in the orchestra to accompany the brass in loud sections of the music and often in choral singing by famous Baroque composers: Johann Sebastian Bach ( 1685-1750) and George Frideric Handel (1685-1759). “Taking part in great music rather than taking a great part in the music” stated Adrian Bending (OAE Principal timpanist). All music in this time was the key of “D”
<br>
The classical period:
In the C19th, composers began to write more interesting timpani parts. This is another one of the causes of the development of the construction of the nowaday pedal timpani. The composers of the time were Mozart, Hydan and Beethoven. After composers began composing in keys other than “D” timpani were more often used. Bathoven revolutionised the timpani, and timpani became an essential part of many composers' pieces. Beethoven pushed the limits of the timpanist, using creative solos and re-tuning the drums, which in those days, was hard.
<br>
The Romantic Period:
	The romantic series saw significant development in the company including the introduction of a pedal mechanism in 1843. In 1835 the first book for timpani methods was published in Paris.
 <br>
Hector Berlioz; a composer of the time, spent a lot of time thinking about and experimenting with what mallets should be used on timpani. He wanted very different sounds and resonances from the timpani, depending on what mallets are being used. Hector believed that a timpanist should have these three pairs of timpani mallets: a pair with with wooden heads which give a much sharper and louder sound; a pair of leather covered heads which still gave a sharp sound but was more appealing; and the third was the sponge head mallets, which give a more varied sound. He always specified which mallets to use.</p>
